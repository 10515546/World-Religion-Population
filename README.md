<h2>Introduction:</h2>

<p>In todayâ€™s world, visualising data has become one of the most important tasks as it helps each and everyone in order to understand the data and then draw conclusions from the same. Here we have attempted to visualise one such data in order to make it easy for the user to understand while at the same time enjoy the brilliant visualisations that were made using it.</p>

<h2>Dataset Selection:</h2>

<p>For the presentaion of the interactive visualizations, we have selected the <b>World Religion Population&nbsp;dataset</b> which can be downloaded <a href="http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/world-religion-data">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

<p>Understanding the diversity of the population based on their religion across the globe.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>

<p>This dataset contains details about the segmentation of the world population based on the religion.</p>

<h2>1.	WHAT MADE US CHOOSE THE PARTICULAR VISUAL ENCODINGS AND INTERACTION TECHNIQUES?</h2>

<ul>
	
After researching the internet in order to find a good method to visualise the data, we decided to use Python programming language for generating our results. Python has a vast resource of libraries which can be used to create exceptional visualisations. Its libraries like Plotly, Bokeh, Seaborn, Matplotlib, etc provide a plethora of resources and are very easy to use and implement.

</ul>

<h2>2.	WHAT ALTERNATIVES DID WE CONSIDER AND HOW DID WE ARRIVE AT THE ULTIMATE CHOICE?</h2>

<ul> 

We looked at Python, R, PowerBI, and Tableau as our primary choices for visualisations. Tableau was the most commonly used and had set themes and schemes, which led us to exclude it. Same was for PowerBI. Now we were left with R and Python. R had a wide range of choices too, but upon further inspection we found out that Python gave very crisp and extremely alterable code UI. Also, R was the most used option, hence we went with python in order to do something different and unique.

</ul>


<h2>Applications Used:</h2>

<p>For this assignment we have used python programing. For better visualisations we have also used libraries such as; bokeh, matplot, plotly, altair. </p>

<h2>Data Visualisation:</h2>

<h3>Islamic Religion Adherents</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Sushanti-Acharya/World-Religion/blob/master/Islam%20Religion%20Region%20Wise.html"><img alt="" src="Islam religion.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>This graph projects the distribution of population who adhere to Islam Religion. We can see the distribution from the year 1945 to 2010.</p>

<p>As shown in the graph, We can see that Middle East has the max population adhering to Islamic Religion. Whereas, it can be observed that at present West.Hemisphere has the most population of Islamic Adherents.</p>

<div>Features for this graph are:</div>

<div>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre"> Box </span>Zoom&nbsp;(can be zoomed to see the details in years)</div>

<div>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Auto Scaling</div>

<h3>Comparing Different Religions Based on Their Population in Different Region </h3>

<p>The 2nd visualisation is an interactive&nbsp;scatter plot showing Hindu, Islamic, Christian and Budhhist population over the period of years based on the regions they are obsereved in. Click on the above image to view the interactive visualisation.</p>

<h3>Population of All Religions Across the Globe from 1945-2010</h3>

<p>In this visualisation, we can see the population of every religion recorded.</p>
<p>On selecting different features, this graph helps us to focus on specific religions or year</p>

<div>Features for this graph are:</div>

<div>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre"> Box </span>Zoom&nbsp;(can be zoomed to see the details per date and time of the day and&nbsp;across the years)</div>

<div>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> Wheel </span>Zoom</div>

<div>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>Taking a screenshot of graph.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&bull;<span style="white-space:pre"> </span>We have also provided save and reset option to help the users save and restore the graph as required.</div>

<div>&bull;<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Additionally an option to learn more about bokeh plot.</div>

<h1>Contribution of Team members:</h1>

<p>The project being a group assignment, every individual invested long hours in designing and developng of visualisations. Understanding the process, deciding the dataset, finalizing the designing language were some of the initial tasks completed as a team.</p>

<p>Data preperation and visualization were equally distributed among all three. The whole process including the webpage creation took us around 30 hours, which involved the meetings, discussions and research on coding practice and learning different tools and libraries.</p>

<p>During the process of developing this project, we learned visualization, but along with it we also experienced working as a team, dealing with agreements, disagreements, challenges, etc which helped in ou overall development.</p>
